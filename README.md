# SAWS-Train-Reservation-System
SAWS is a train reservation system that allows for customers to book trains, customer representatives to assist customers to book trains, and an overall admin to add more customer representatives, monitor sales, and ensure that all aspects of the reservation system are working and functional. This project utilizes mySQL, JDBC, Java, HTML and CSS to establish a user-friendly interface on a local server.

Below is some credential information that already exists in the system and can be used to test it out. Note that it is possible to register more customer representatives and customers on the local server directly, but not another admin account.

**Admin Credentials** <br>
Username: admin_user <br>
Password: admin_password <br>

**Customer Representative Credentials** <br>
Username: csr_user <br>
Password: csr_password <br>

**Customer Credentials** <br>
Username: test_user2 <br>
Password: password <br>
